# NBA on ESPN iCalendar file generator

I wanted an iCalendar file to keep track of what NBA games ESPN shows, like what I found for the [http://www.kuathletics.com/schedule.aspx?path=mbball&print=true&version=1](KU Men's Basketball schedule).

So, this script takes [the NBA on ESPN schedule](http://espn.go.com/nba/television) from the web and turns it into an iCalendar file.
